# 📊 Stock-Market-ELT

This project is a hands-on implementation of an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline built on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC). The goal was to get practical experience with cloud services, APIs, data pipelines, and SQL-based data transformations — seeing how everything fits together in a real-world workflow.

# 📌 Workflow
# ⚙️ Tech Stack
  - -Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
      - Cloud Storage — for storing raw JSON files (Bronze Layer)
      - BigQuery — for staging, transforming, and aggregating data (Silver & Gold Layers)
  - Terraform — infrastructure as code (IaC) for managing GCP resources
  - Python (Pandas) — for processing and structuring API response data
  - Financial Modeling Prep [API](https://financialmodelingprep.com/)
  - Notion - for project planning and execution steps
      - [Plan](https://bronzed-ixia-965.notion.site/Project-Stock-Market-ELT-on-Google-Cloud-ELT-Medallion-pipeline-on-GCP-cleanly-structured-into-E-2174a269255a80c88935e46908456432)

# 💡 Reflections
I really enjoyed working on this project and learned a lot in the process. It wasn’t all smooth sailing — I ran into plenty of issues, from Terraform refusing to create a BigQuery dataset to completely breaking my GitHub Codespace and losing part of my work while trying to recover it. But that’s all part of the process. Every bug, misstep, and fix helped me build a better understanding of cloud data workflows and infrastructure as code, moving me closer to my goal of becoming learning more engineering skills.
